# DESIGN A DATABASE
## 1. Understand the Requirements
Start by clarifying questions or stating your assumptions about the core functionalities:

- User registration and authentication
- Restaurant listing and management
- Menu and food item management
- Order placement and tracking
- Payment processing
- Reviews and ratings
- Delivery management

## 2. Identify Key Entities
Think about the main objects in the system:

- Users (customers, restaurant owners, delivery partners)
- Restaurants
- Food items/Menu
- Orders
- Payments
- Reviews
- Delivery tracking

## 3. Design the Core Tables
**Users Table:**
``
user_id, name, email, phone, address, user_type (customer/restaurant_owner/delivery_partner)
``

**Restaurants Table:**
``
restaurant_id, name, address, cuisine_type, rating, opening_hours, contact_info
``

**Menu Items Table:**
``
item_id, restaurant_id, name, description, price, category, availability
``

**Orders Table:**
``
order_id, user_id, restaurant_id, order_status, total_amount, order_time, delivery_address
``

**Order Items Table:** ``order_item_id, order_id, item_id, quantity, price``


**Reviews Table:** ``review_id, user_id, restaurant_id, rating, comment, review_date``

## 4. Define Relationships
Establish foreign key relationships:

- Orders → Users (many-to-one)
- Orders → Restaurants (many-to-one)
- Order Items → Orders (many-to-one)
- Menu Items → Restaurants (many-to-one)
- Reviews → Users and Restaurants

## 5. Consider Scalability & Performance
Discuss indexing strategies:

- Index on user_id, restaurant_id for faster lookups

- Composite indexes on location-based queries

- Consider partitioning large tables like orders by date

## 6. Address Additional Concerns

Data normalization to avoid redundancy

Handle different payment methods

Store delivery tracking information

Consider caching frequently accessed data

Discuss backup and recovery strategies
