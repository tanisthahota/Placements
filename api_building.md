# API Design 

## 1. Understand the Use Case
- **System Type:** (e.g., social media, e-commerce, messaging)  
- **Main Users:** End users, internal services, third parties  
- **Core Functionalities:** Define essential operations (e.g., posting, buying, messaging)  
- **Constraints:** Scale, performance requirements, existing systems integration  

---

## 2. Core Resources
Identify main entities based on requirements:

- **Social Media:** Users, Posts, Comments, Likes  
- **E-commerce:** Users, Products, Orders, Payments  

---

## 3. Design URL Structure
Follow **RESTful conventions**:

```http
GET /users             # List users
GET /users/{id}        # Get specific user
POST /users            # Create new user
PUT /users/{id}        # Update user
DELETE /users/{id}     # Delete user

GET /users/{id}/posts  # Get user's posts
POST /posts            # Create new post
```

## 4. Define Request/Response Format

Use JSON format.

Example:
```
// GET /users/{id} response
{
  "id": 123,
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```
## 5. Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication Methods:** API keys, OAuth

**Authorization Levels:**

- Public access

- User-specific access

- Admin-only access

## 6. Handle Error Cases

Return structured error responses.

Example:
```
{
  "error": {
    "code": 404,
    "message": "User not found",
    "details": "User with id 123 does not exist"
  }
}
```
## 7. Scalability & Performance

- Pagination for large datasets

- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

- Caching strategies for frequent requests

- Database considerations (indexes, sharding, replication)

- Load balancing across servers
