1. Understand the usecase

What type of system are we building? (e.g., social media, e-commerce, messaging)
Who are the main users? (end users, internal services, third parties)
What are the core functionalities needed?
Any specific constraints? (scale, performance, existing systems)

2. Core Resources
identify main entities based on requirements:

For a social media app: Users, Posts, Comments, Likes
For e-commerce: Users, Products, Orders, Payments


3. Design URL Structure 
RESTful conventions:

GET /users - List users
GET /users/{id} - Get specific user
POST /users - Create new user
PUT /users/{id} - Update user
DELETE /users/{id} - Delete user

GET /users/{id}/posts - Get user's posts
POST /posts - Create new post

4. Define Request/Response Format 
Specify data structures:
json// GET /users/{id} response
{
  "id": 123,
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}

5. Authentication & Authorization

Authentication method (API keys, OAuth)
Authorization levels (public, user-specific, admin-only)


6. Handle Error Cases 
Error responses:

json{
  "error": {
    "code": 404,
    "message": "User not found",
    "details": "User with id 123 does not exist"
  }
}

7. Scalability & Performance 

Pagination for large datasets
Rate limiting
Caching strategies
Database considerations
Load balancing
